# GLP-1 Drug-Drug Interaction Predictor
## Kohl Goldsmith for MTU SAT5141 Clinical Decision Support & AI Modelling

### Purpose
  The idea of this project is to provide AI driven predictions in drug-drug interactions. Specifically involving the more frequently used and novel GLP-1 drugs like semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus), 
  dulaglutide (Trulicity), liraglutide (Victoza, Saxenda), exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon), and tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound).

### Configuration / Setup
  Copy the directory schema of the Github through cloning or manual setup.

### Running the file for validation
  Run main.py, watching for errors in saving, data is recommended to come from 2024 or newer.
  Once this is completed, real analysis can be done.
